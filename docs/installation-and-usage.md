Code for analysis of each of the tasks is contained in the [tasks](/tasks) directory. A working copy of the code is in the root of each task, and supplementary files (e.g. code acquired from other researchers) is contained in the dev directory for each task (for example [here for FERT](/tasks/FERT/dev)).

Analysis is conducted in R. Inputs are data files for participants who have completed the task. Files should either be stored locally or on OSF. If on OSF, these can be read into the analysis directly from the R script . Accessing (non-public) data on OSF will require you to generate an OSF Personal Access Token. See the instructions in [FERT-analysis code](/tasks/FERT/FERT-analysis.Rmd).
